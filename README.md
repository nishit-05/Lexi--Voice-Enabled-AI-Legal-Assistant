# Lexi – Voice-Enabled AI Legal Assistant

Lexi is a **voice-powered AI legal assistant** designed to provide real-time legal guidance through seamless, hands-free interaction.  
She interprets **spoken legal queries**, analyzes context, and generates accurate, conversational responses using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Generative AI**.


## Purpose

Lexi was built with the vision to **democratize access to legal guidance**.  
By integrating **Speech-to-Text (STT)** and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** technologies, she enables individuals and businesses to interact naturally — making legal information **accessible, affordable, and conversational** anytime, anywhere.


## What Lexi Does

- **Understands voice-based legal queries** using advanced **STT** processing.  
- **Generates accurate and context-aware legal responses** using **LLMs** and **NLP pipelines**.  
- **Uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to ground responses in factual data.  
- **Replies with natural speech** via TTS, providing a human-like interaction experience.  
- **Bridges the gap between AI and law**, making reliable legal information accessible to everyone.


## Tech Stack

**Languages & Frameworks:**  
- Python  

**Core Libraries:**  
- TensorFlow  
- NumPy  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- SpeechRecognition  
- pyttsx3 / gTTS  

**Concepts & Techniques:**  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS)  
- Conversational AI and Context Understanding  


## System Overview

Lexi’s architecture follows an **end-to-end AI pipeline**:

1. **Speech Input** → Captured via microphone  
2. **STT Conversion** → Converts voice to text  
3. **NLP Processing** → Intent recognition, semantic understanding, context tracking  
4. **RAG + LLM Response Generation** → Retrieves relevant legal data, generates structured response  
5. **TTS Output** → Converts text back to natural speech for the user  


## Future Improvements

- Integration with **cloud databases** for scalable knowledge retrieval  
- Addition of **multi-language support** for diverse user accessibility  
- Enhanced **context memory** for multi-turn conversations
  

## Vision

Lexi aims to become a **trustworthy AI companion** in the legal space — bridging technology and justice through the power of **AI, NLP, and voice interaction**.
